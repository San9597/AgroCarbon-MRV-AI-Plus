🌍 AgroCarbon MRV-AI+
🚀 Next-Gen MRV Platform for Farmers & Industries

AgroCarbon MRV-AI+ is a farmer-first, AI-assisted, industry-ready MRV (Measurement, Reporting, and Verification) platform. It combines AI, IoT, remote sensing, gamification, and multilingual farmer support into one unified system.
